// Leap Year Challenge Exercise
// 💪This is a Difficult Challenge 💪

// Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video goes into more detail.

// This is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:

// A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;

// except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;

// unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.

function isLeapYear(year) {
  if (year % 4 === 0) {
    if (year % 100 === 0) {
      if (year % 400 === 0) {
        return "Leap year.";
      } else {
        return "Not leap year.";
      }
    } else {
      return "Leap year.";
    }
  } else {
    return "Not leap year.";
  }
}

// e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?:

// 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

// 2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

// 2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

// So the year 2000 is a leap year.

// But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

// 2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)

// 2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

// 2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

// Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

// Example Input 1

// 2400
// Example Output 1

// Leap year.

// Example Input 2

// 1989

// Example Output 2

// Not leap year.

// Hint

// Remember that the modulo (%) operator gives you the remainder of a division. We covered this in this lesson.

// Try to visualise the rules by creating a flow chart on www.draw.io.

// If you really get stuck, you can see the flow chart I created.

// Try to run your code in this Repl.it playground and check it against the known leap years.
