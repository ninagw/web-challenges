// Javascript Variables Exercise
// Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

// var a = "3";
// var b = "8";
// So that the variable a holds the value "8".

// And the variable b holds the value "3".

// When the code is run, it should output:

// a is 8

// b is 3

// Do NOT change any of the existing code.

// You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.

// You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.

// Hint: Use this code playground to run your code and see if it matches your expectations.

// Hint: The solution is just 3 lines of code.
